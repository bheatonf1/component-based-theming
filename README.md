# Component-based Theming with Twig

This repository is for using a Composer based workflow with Drupal 8.  We will be using this repository and the branches to maintain various snapshots as we progress thru each lesson.

## Assumptions

This training assumes that you are already running Acquia Dev Desktop and have a familiarity with installing Drupal using the standard means of downloading, setting up a database, configuring a localhost, and completing the browser-based install. In the [Master](https://github.com/forumone/component-based-theming/tree/master#component-based-theming-with-twig) repo, we walked through quickly installing **Acquia Dev Desktop**, **Terminal**, **Composer**, **Node & NPM**, **Grunt**, and **Git**. Ensure that you have a working AMP stack and are comfortable working within the command-line interface using a Terminal window before continuing.

## Lesson One: Overview

In order to fully take advantage of componentizing Drupal, it helps to have an understanding of components, patterns and the differences between traditional theme-centric design and component-based design.  We will take a look at patterns that make up common web elements, break them down into smaller pieces and explain how they better fit into what is known as the atomic design principle.
