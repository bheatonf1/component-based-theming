# Button

## Step One - Building a component
Creating a component is actually quite easy.  All that we need is a twig template with the name of our component and the HTML markup that makes up our component.

- Create a new file called `button.twig`
- Add the following markup:

```
    <a href="#" class="button">Learn More</a>
```

- Save the file
- Refresh your browser and navigate to http://pwc.dd:8083/themes/pwc/pattern-lab/public/?p=components-button to view our component

## Step Two - Using Data attributes
Currently our component displays static values for the URL and Label of our anchor element.  However, we can make this component a little more dynamic by using Data attributes and Twig variables to replace our static values with dynamic values.

- Create a new file called `button.yml`
- Add the following key and value pairs, keeping in mind that YAML requires specific formatting:

```
    button_url: "#"
    button_label: "Learn More"
```

- Save the file
- Edit `button.twig` and replace the static values with Twig variables for each attribute.

```
    <a href="{{ button_url }}" class="button">{{ button_label }}</a>
```

- Save the file
- If Grunt does not recognize the new YML file or changes to it, try stopping and restarting the `grunt` task.
- Refresh your browser and navigate to http://pwc.dd:8083/themes/pwc/pattern-lab/public/?p=components-button to view our component.


## Step Three - Using Includes to create a variant
Creating a variant of a component comes in handy when we need an identical version of a component with only slight modifications.  For example, the button within the Hero component is much like the normal button, except it has an outline.

While we could simply duplicate our button component markup in a separate component file,  we should follow the DRY principle (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) which will make the code base simpler and future maintenance easier.

Twig allows us to reference one template within another and return the rendered content of that file using what is called an `include`.  Lets try this by following these steps.

- Create a new Twig file within our button folder called `button-outline.twig` and include our original `button.twig` template within it by adding the following:

```
    {% include "components-button %}
```

> Note that an include within Pattern Lab follows the root folder and component file name that is being referenced.  In the case above, the button.twig file located in the 01-components/button folder can be referenced by stating components-button.  There is no need to include the absolute or relative path, subfolders or file extension.

- Save the file
- Refresh your browser and navigate to http://pwc.dd:8083/themes/pwc/pattern-lab/public/?p=components-button-outline to view our button-outline component.


## Step Four: Using data attributes with Includes
Our **button-outline** component now has the same markup as our original **button** component.  In order to alter it, we will need a way to pass it variables.

The `include` statement we used above can be used to pass variables to the original button component that will override the data attributes being displayed.  To do this we can add the  `with` attribute.

- Edit `button-outline.twig` and add the following `with` statement to our include:

```
    {% include "components-button
      with {
        button_label: "Learn More",
        button_url: "#"
      }
    %}
```

- Save the file
- Refresh your browser and navigate to http://pwc.dd:8083/themes/pwc/pattern-lab/public/?p=components-button-outline to view our button-outline component.

Our button-outline component should still look the same, however if you change the value  `button_label` inside the `with`  statement, save the file and refresh the browser, you should see that the label being displayed is changed.


## Step Five: Adding a class modifier
We are almost done with our button-outline component variant.  The only missing step is the ability to add a variant class to the original button component that we can use to pass additional CSS to this variant.

Begin with adding a new key and value pair to the `button.yml` file.

- Edit `button.yml` and add the following `button_modifier` key with an empty value:

```
    button_modifier: ""
    button_url: "#"
    button_label: "Learn More"
```

- Save the file

Next we will need to print out the value of our new key within `button.twig`

- Edit `button.twig` and add the following Twig variable:

```
    <a href="{{ button_url }}" class="button {{ button_modifier }}">{{ button_label }}</a>
```

- Save the file

Finally, all we need to do is update our `button-outline.twig` file and pass the variant class within our include.

- Edit `button-outline.twig` and add the `button_modifier` key and value pair to the existing `with` statement:

```
    {% include "components-button
      with {
        button_modifier: "button--outline",
        button_label: "Learn More",
        button_url: "#"
      }
    %}
```

- Save the file
- Refresh your browser and navigate to http://pwc.dd:8083/themes/pwc/pattern-lab/public/?p=components-button-outline to view our button-outline component.

Our button-outline component now has the correct styling, and if we compare the two button components we can see that each is being displayed slightly differently, yet both use the same base template as the source for their markup.
