# Homepage

## Step One - Building a page
Creating a template is actually quite easy.  All that we need is a twig template with the name of our page and the HTML markup that makes up our component.

- Create a new file called `homepage.twig`
- Add the following markup:

```
  {% include "templates-homepage" %}
```

- Save the file
- Refresh your browser and navigate to http://pwc.dd:8083/themes/pwc/pattern-lab/public/?p=pages-homepage to view our page.

Our Homepage page is now complete.
